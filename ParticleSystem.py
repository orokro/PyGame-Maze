"""
	ParticleSystem.py
	-----------------

	This file/module will define a class for our ParticleSystem,
	which under normal circumstances I would call "Particle Manager"

	but ParticleSystem seems like a more appropriate naming scheme for this.

	Anyway, this class _manages_ the spawning / movement / life cycle / collision of particles.

	NOTE:

	This particle system will define and manage particles _for _ this _ game _ !!

	Meaning: this is not a generic game engine class, its particle names and etc is for this solution.
