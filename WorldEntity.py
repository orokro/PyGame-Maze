	I may be prematurely optimizing and/or overengineering here, but hear me out:

	All the things in our main GameScene will probably need co-ordinates on screen, maybe rotation as well.

	They'll probably all want a reference tot he scene and a reference to the window.

	So lets make a base class here for world entities, just 'cause
