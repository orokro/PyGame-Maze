	Camera.py
	---------

	This file/module provides a class that acts as a logical camera.

	Note, that I say 'logical camera' because this camera does not actually render anything!

	(That will all be handled in our GameScreen.render() method)

	Rather, this class will just store the X/Y location in the game world we should be rendering.

	Also, possibly prodive some function for Zoom, Rotate, or Lerp-Pan down the road.

	So, in otherwords, this handles the logic around the games "camera", not actually rendering.
